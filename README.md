OCaml from the Very Begining
============================

These are the examples and exercises for the book "OCaml from the Very
Beginning" which can be obtained at
[http://www.ocaml-book.com/](http://www.ocaml-book.com).

The directories for Chapters 2 to 15 contain two files each, one with the
examples from the text of the chapter, and one with the answers to the
exercises. Where answers depend on functions written earlier, they are included
in the file too.

Chapter 16 has its own README file.
